### Troubleshooting 'BRB! Connecting to CockroachDB' 
#### This happens occassionally when the project has been running for a while. It may go to sleep. Simply reload the page and wait a few minutes while the project wakes up and restarts the DB process. 
*** If you really want, you may also go into the Glitch Console and type 'sh cockroach.sh'. Hit <enter> to execute the DB process manually. I suggest this as a last resort though.

Your Project

- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
